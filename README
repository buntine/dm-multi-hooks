 dm-multi-hooks 0.0.1
=================================

By Andrew Buntine

A plugin for DataMapper that allows you to add single/multiple hooks to single/multiple methods in a convenient way.

For example:

  before [ :create, :destroy ], [ :do_something, :and_another_thing ]

is equivelant to:

  before :create, :do_something
  before :create, :and_another_thing
  before :destroy, :do_something
  before :destroy, :and_another_thing
  
...And:

  after :create, [ :set_name, :set_encoding, :increment_cache ]

is_equivelant to:

  after :create, :set_name
  after :create, :set_encoding
  after :create, :increment_cache
